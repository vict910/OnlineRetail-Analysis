# Online Retail Data Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes an online retail dataset to extract meaningful insights on **revenue trends, customer behavior, and sales performance**. The dataset includes **transaction details, customer demographics, and product sales information**, making it ideal for business intelligence and data analytics.

##  Key Objectives
- **Revenue Analysis**: Identify total revenue trends over time.
- **Best-Selling Products**: Find the top-performing items based on sales.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Classify customers into new vs. returning.
- **Geographic Insights**: Discover which countries generate the most revenue.
- **Time-Based Sales Patterns**: Analyze peak shopping hours and seasonal trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** ‚Äì For data storage and querying.
- **SQL (T-SQL)** ‚Äì Data analysis and transformation.
- **Power BI** (optional) ‚Äì Visualization of business insights.
- **Python (Pandas)** (optional) ‚Äì Data cleaning and preprocessing.

##  Key SQL Queries
### **1Ô∏è Monthly Revenue Trends**
```sql
SELECT FORMAT(InvoiceDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
       SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM OnlineRetail
GROUP BY FORMAT(InvoiceDate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month;
```
 Helps track revenue fluctuations and seasonal trends.

### **2Ô∏è Best-Selling Products**
```sql
SELECT TOP 10 StockCode, Description,
       SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSold,
       SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM OnlineRetail
GROUP BY StockCode, Description
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;
```
 Identifies top-performing products for strategic sales decisions.

### **3Ô∏è Customer Segmentation**
```sql
SELECT CustomerID,
       COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS OrdersCount,
       CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) = 1 THEN 'New Customer'
            ELSE 'Returning Customer'
       END AS CustomerType
FROM OnlineRetail
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY OrdersCount DESC;
```
 Categorizes customers into **new vs. returning** for targeted marketing.

##  Future Improvements
- **Enhance visualizations in Power BI** (e.g., dashboards for revenue trends, customer segmentation).
- **Perform advanced statistical analysis** using Python (e.g., forecasting, A/B testing).
- **Optimize SQL queries** for better performance on large datasets.
